Hereâ€™s an algorithm summary and an error-free Mermaid flowchart for your nonDivisibleSubset function:

Algorithm (Largest Non-Divisible Subset):

Compute remainder counts:

For each number in the array, count the number of elements for each remainder modulo k.

Start with at most one element with remainder 0.

For each remainder i in [1, k/2]:

Add the larger count between remainder i and remainder k - i to the result.

If k is even, make sure to add only one from the remainder k/2 bucket.

Return the result.
